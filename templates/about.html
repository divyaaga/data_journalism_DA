  <h1>Car Crashes in New York City</h1>
  <p class="overall-description">Hi! My project explores the number of car crashes in the different boroughs of NYC over the last ten years. I wanted to see if various external events, like COVID, had significant impacts on the number of car crashes. I also wanted to see if one borough consistently had more car crashes than the others.   </p>

  <h3>How I Got My Data</h3>
  <p class="data-description">I first found my dataset from data.gov. Then, I removed all of the car crashes that did not have a borough attached. This means that the data that I haven't presented does not tell the complete story; rather, it is a reflection of all the car crashes that were recorded appropriately for my project. Then I sorted all the car crashes by borough and year and summed the data.</p>

  <h3>Vocab</h3>
  <p class="vocab">Data.gov: An open access US government website containing over 300,000 data sets.</p>
  <p class="vocab">Car Crashes: Any incident involving a collision between at least two vehiclesâ€”this collision does not need to be fatal.</p>
  <p class="vocab">Boroughs: NYC is broken up into 5 boroughs: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island.</p>
